Hey, it's nice to hear from you. I'm not doing so well, I could use some refreshments so that I can grow. 
Hello, it's so good to hear from you. I'm a bit thirsty, please get me some water. That would be so lovely
Hello, it's such a nice day. Could you bring me some water that would make my day even brighter, thank you 
Hello there, I'm doing okay but I could use a little sip of water. While you get my refreshment, here is a little poem you might enjoy. I am like a flower that is raised with love by you. You help me grow up big and strong. Thanks for all you do!
